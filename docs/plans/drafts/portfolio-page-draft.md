## PAGE BODY (Markdown)

I build things that work — and I fix things that almost do.

If you used AI tools to build your app and it _mostly_ works but you've got
a nagging feeling something's off — you're probably right. AI-generated code
ships fast, breaks quietly, and hides security holes in places you wouldn't
think to look. I find those places.

I recently built [Grove](https://grove.place) — a full production SaaS
platform (auth, payments, email, CDN, database, the works) — largely with
AI-assisted development. I know exactly where these tools shine and exactly
where they fall apart. I use them every day. I also spend a _lot_ of time
cleaning up after them.

### What I Do

**Code Cleanup & Refactoring**
Your AI-generated codebase works, but it's a mess under the hood. I refactor
it into something a human can actually maintain — consistent patterns, proper
error handling, dead code removed, logic untangled.

**Production Hardening**
The gap between "it runs on my machine" and "it runs in production, reliably,
at 3am when nobody's watching" is bigger than most people think. I handle
CI/CD, logging, error tracking, deployment pipelines, and all the invisible
infrastructure that keeps things alive.

**Security Auditing**
This is where I come from. AI tools casually introduce SQL injection, XSS,
broken auth, hardcoded secrets, and missing input validation — and they do it
confidently. I find those vulnerabilities before someone else does.

### The Stack

I work across the modern web stack, with a focus on edge-first architecture:

- **Frontend:** SvelteKit, TypeScript, JavaScript, HTML/CSS
- **Backend:** Cloudflare Workers, Node.js, Python
- **Data:** SQLite (D1), PostgreSQL, KV stores, R2 object storage
- **Auth:** OAuth 2.0, PKCE, session management, CSRF/XSS protection
- **Infra:** Cloudflare (Workers, Pages, D1, R2, KV), GitHub Actions, CI/CD
- **Security:** OWASP Top 10, input validation, CSP, rate limiting, secrets management

---

### How It Works

1. **You reach out** — tell me what you've got and what's bugging you
2. **Free assessment** — I take 30 minutes to look at your codebase and tell you what I'd fix, no strings attached
3. **Clear quote** — fixed price for defined work, or hourly for ongoing support. No surprises.
4. **I deliver** — clean, tested, documented code. You get a before/after summary so you can see exactly what changed and why.

I work async and remote. I communicate clearly and I don't ghost.

### Why Hire Me

I'm not going to give you a résumé. I'm going to tell you what I built.

**Grove** is a multi-tenant blogging platform running on Cloudflare's edge
network. Full OAuth authentication with PKCE. Stripe and LemonSqueezy
payment integration. Transactional email. R2 media storage. D1 databases
with migrations. Rate limiting. Content security policies. Automated
CI/CD. Five subscription tiers. A custom admin panel. A markdown editor
with live preview. Dozens of interactive components. Accessibility-first.
Dark mode. Seasonal themes.

I built it in 87 days. It runs cleanly, scales quietly, and costs less
than $30/month in infrastructure.

That's what production-ready looks like. I can make your project look
like that too.

### <a id="contact"></a> Let's Talk

**Email:** autumn@grove.place
**GitHub:** [AutumnsGrove](https://github.com/AutumnsGrove)
**Bluesky:** [@groveplace.bsky.social](https://bsky.app/profile/groveplace.bsky.social)

I usually respond within a day. Tell me what you're working on — even if
you're not sure what you need yet, I'm happy to take a look.

<!-- NOTE TO SELF:
- ~~Update Bluesky handle when ready~~ DONE
- Consider adding 1-2 testimonials once you have clients
- "Security Auditing" can become its own section when you're ready to tier up
- LATER: templatize this for other Grove users (don't get distracted now)
