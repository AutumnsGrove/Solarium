## FREELANCE SERVICES AGREEMENT

**Between:** Autumn ("Developer")
**And:** [Client Name] ("Client")
**Date:** [Date]
**Project:** [One-line project description]

---

### 1. Scope of Work

The Developer will perform the following work ("the Work"):

> [Describe the specific deliverables here. Be concrete. Examples:]
>
> - Audit the existing SvelteKit codebase for security vulnerabilities
>   and deliver a written report of findings
> - Refactor the authentication system to use proper session management
> - Add input validation to all API endpoints
> - Write tests for the refactored code

**The Work includes ONLY what is described above.** Any work not
explicitly listed is outside the scope of this agreement. Additional
requests are welcome — they will be quoted separately.

---

### 2. What's NOT Included

To be completely clear, this agreement does NOT cover:

- Maintenance, hosting, or monitoring after delivery
- Future bugs caused by changes made by the Client or third parties
  after delivery
- Features, improvements, or fixes not listed in Section 1
- Ongoing support or availability after the warranty period (Section 5)
- Any third-party services, APIs, or tools the project depends on
- Performance of the Client's hosting, domain, DNS, or infrastructure

---

### 3. Deliverables & Timeline

**Deliverables:**

> [List what the Client will actually receive. Examples:]
>
> - Refactored codebase delivered as a pull request / branch / zip
> - Written security audit report (PDF or Markdown)
> - Before/after summary of changes
> - [Any other tangible outputs]

**Estimated timeline:** [X business days / weeks] from the start date.

The start date is the date payment is received (see Section 4). Timelines
are estimates, not guarantees. The Developer will communicate proactively
if the timeline shifts.

---

### 4. Payment

**Total fee:** $[amount]

**Payment structure:** [Choose one]

- [ ] **Fixed price:** 50% due upfront before work begins. Remaining 50%
      due upon delivery. Work does not begin until the first payment is
      received.
- [ ] **Hourly:** $[rate]/hour, billed weekly. Payment due within 7 days
      of invoice. A maximum of [X] hours is authorized under this
      agreement. If the work requires more hours, a new estimate will
      be provided for approval before proceeding.

**Late payment:** Invoices unpaid after 14 days will incur a 5% late fee.
Invoices unpaid after 30 days may result in work being paused until
payment is received.

**Refund policy:** If the Developer has not yet begun work, the upfront
payment is fully refundable. Once work has begun, payment for completed
work is non-refundable. Partial work will be delivered for partial payment.

---

### 5. Warranty Period

The Developer provides a **14-day warranty period** from the date of
delivery.

During this period, the Developer will fix — at no additional cost — any
bugs in the specific code delivered under this agreement, provided:

- The bug is in code the Developer wrote or modified
- The Client has not modified the delivered code
- The bug is reported in writing (email is fine)
- The bug relates to the Work described in Section 1

**After the warranty period expires, no further free work is owed.** The
Client is welcome to engage the Developer for additional work under a
new agreement.

---

### 6. Change Requests

If the Client requests work outside the scope defined in Section 1, the
Developer will:

1. Acknowledge the request
2. Provide a separate quote for the additional work
3. Only proceed with the additional work after the Client approves the
   new quote in writing

**Scope changes do not modify the original agreement.** They are treated
as new, separate engagements.

---

### 7. Limitation of Liability

**The Developer's total liability under this agreement is limited to the
total fee paid by the Client.**

The Developer is NOT liable for:

- Loss of revenue, data, or business resulting from the Work
- Issues caused by the Client's modifications to the delivered code
- Issues caused by third-party services, hosting, or infrastructure
- Issues discovered after the warranty period
- Business decisions made based on the Developer's audit or
  recommendations
- Security breaches that exploit vulnerabilities outside the scope of
  the audit (if the Work is a security audit, it covers what was
  explicitly agreed — not every possible vulnerability in the Client's
  entire system)

**The Work is provided "as-is" after the warranty period.** The Developer
makes no guarantees about the Client's business outcomes, uptime,
revenue, or security beyond what is explicitly delivered.

---

### 8. Intellectual Property

Upon receipt of full payment:

- The Client owns all code written or modified by the Developer under
  this agreement
- The Developer retains the right to use general knowledge, techniques,
  and non-proprietary patterns learned during the engagement
- The Developer may reference the project in their portfolio (e.g.,
  "security audit for a SvelteKit application") without revealing
  confidential details, unless the Client requests otherwise in writing

If full payment is not received, the Developer retains ownership of all
work product until payment is complete.

---

### 9. Confidentiality

The Developer will not share, publish, or disclose:

- The Client's source code
- API keys, credentials, or secrets encountered during the Work
- Business logic, proprietary algorithms, or trade secrets
- Any information the Client marks as confidential

This obligation survives the end of this agreement.

---

### 10. Communication

- All project communication will happen via [email / Slack / Discord /
  specify]
- The Developer will provide progress updates at [frequency — e.g.,
  "upon completion of each deliverable" or "weekly"]
- The Client agrees to respond to questions within [2-3] business days
  to avoid delays

---

### 11. Termination

Either party may end this agreement with written notice (email is fine).

**If the Client terminates:**

- Payment is due for all work completed up to the termination date
- Completed work will be delivered
- The upfront payment is non-refundable if work has begun

**If the Developer terminates:**

- All completed work will be delivered
- The Client will only be charged for work completed
- Any overpayment will be refunded within 14 days

---

### 12. Dispute Resolution

Both parties agree to attempt to resolve any dispute through direct
communication first. If that fails, disputes will be resolved through
mediation or small claims court in [your state/jurisdiction].

---

### Agreement

By signing below (or replying "I agree" to the email containing this
agreement), both parties confirm they have read, understand, and agree
to these terms.

**Developer:**
Name: Autumn
Date: ******\_\_\_******
Signature: ******\_\_\_******

**Client:**
Name: ******\_\_\_******
Date: ******\_\_\_******
Signature: ******\_\_\_******

<!-- AUTUMN'S NOTES:
- Fill in Section 1 (scope) fresh for every client. NEVER reuse scope
  from a previous project without reviewing it.
- Fill in Section 3 (deliverables) with tangible outputs. "Clean up the
  code" is not a deliverable. "Refactored auth module with tests" is.
- For small gigs (<$1,000), the email reply "I agree" is sufficient.
  For larger gigs, get a real signature (DocuSign, or printed).
- The 14-day warranty is generous but bounded. Do NOT extend it verbally.
  If they want longer support, that's a maintenance contract (new agreement).
- The liability cap (Section 7) is the most important clause. It means
  if their site gets hacked, the MOST you owe is a refund — not damages.
- EVENTUALLY: have a real lawyer in your state review this. ~$200-500
  for a contract review. Worth it once you're doing steady work.
- For security audits specifically, add a line to Section 1 like:
  "This audit covers [specific areas]. It is not a guarantee that no
  vulnerabilities exist outside the audited scope."
