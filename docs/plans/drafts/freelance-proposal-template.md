## PROPOSAL

**To:** [Client Name]
**From:** Autumn
**Date:** [Date]
**Re:** [One-line project description]

---

### The Problem

[2-3 sentences describing THEIR problem in THEIR words. Mirror back what
they told you. This shows you listened.]

> Example: "You've got a SvelteKit app that was largely built with AI
> tools, and it's live — but you're not confident in the auth system,
> there are no tests, and you've had a couple of unexplained errors in
> production. You need someone to go in, find the problems, and fix them."

---

### What I'll Do

[Numbered list of specific deliverables. Be concrete. Each item should
be something the client can verify as "done" or "not done."]

1. [Deliverable 1 — e.g., "Audit the authentication flow and deliver a
   written security report"]
2. [Deliverable 2 — e.g., "Refactor session management to use secure,
   httpOnly cookies with proper expiry"]
3. [Deliverable 3 — e.g., "Add input validation to all 12 API endpoints"]
4. [Deliverable 4 — e.g., "Write integration tests for auth and API layers"]
5. [Deliverable 5 — e.g., "Deliver a before/after summary of all changes"]

---

### What's NOT Included

[Be explicit. This saves you from scope creep later.]

- Hosting, deployment, or ongoing maintenance
- Features or pages not mentioned above
- Design or UI changes
- [Anything else relevant to this specific project]

If you'd like any of these added, I'm happy to quote them separately.

---

### Timeline

**Estimated delivery:** [X] business days from start date.
**Start date:** The day I receive the first payment.

I'll keep you updated on progress at [frequency — e.g., "each milestone"
or "every few days via email"].

---

### Investment

**Option A — Fixed Price (recommended for this scope):**

| Item                     | Fee           |
| ------------------------ | ------------- |
| [Deliverables 1-5 above] | $[amount]     |
| **Total**                | **$[amount]** |

50% due upfront to begin. Remaining 50% due on delivery.

**Option B — Hourly:**

$[rate]/hour, estimated [X-Y] hours. Billed weekly. Maximum [Z] hours
authorized without a new estimate.

> [Pick one option and delete the other, or offer both and let the
> > client choose. Offering both shows flexibility.]

---

### What Happens Next

1. You reply with any questions or say "let's go"
2. I send the Services Agreement (attached) for your approval
3. You approve the agreement and send the first payment
4. I start work on [start date or "the next business day"]
5. You get clean, tested, documented code by [delivery date]

---

### About Me

I'm a developer and security specialist. I recently built
[Grove](https://grove.place) — a full multi-tenant SaaS platform — from
scratch: auth, payments, email, database, CDN, admin panel, the works.
I use AI tools daily and I know exactly where they help and where they
introduce problems.

I work async and remote. I communicate clearly and I don't disappear.

<!-- AUTUMN'S NOTES ON USING THIS TEMPLATE:

BEFORE SENDING, check:
- [ ] Did I mirror their problem back in their own words?
- [ ] Are all deliverables specific and verifiable?
- [ ] Did I list what's NOT included?
- [ ] Is the price based on my hours estimate x 1.5?
- [ ] Did I attach the Services Agreement?
- [ ] Did I sleep on it? (Send tomorrow, not tonight)

TONE RULES:
- Short paragraphs. No walls of text.
- Confident, not salesy. You're offering to help, not begging for work.
- No "I think" or "I believe" or "I would suggest." Just state what
  you'll do.
- No jargon the client wouldn't understand. "Fix your login security"
  not "implement PKCE OAuth with httpOnly session cookies."
- Mirror their language. If they said "it's buggy," say "bugs." If they
  said "security concerns," say "security." Match their frame.

PRICING NOTES:
- Always show the total prominently. Don't make them do math.
- 50/50 split is standard for projects under $5,000.
- For projects over $5,000, consider 30/40/30 (start/midpoint/delivery).
- NEVER do 100% on delivery. You will get stiffed eventually.
- If they push back on price, don't lower the rate — reduce the scope.
  "I can do items 1-3 for $X. Items 4-5 can be a follow-up project."
