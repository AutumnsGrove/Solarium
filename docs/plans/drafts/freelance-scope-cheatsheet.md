## Before You Respond to ANY Inquiry

### The 5-Question Gate

Ask yourself these questions. If you can't answer YES to all five,
you're not ready to accept. Ask the client more questions first.

| #   | Question                                        | Yes? |
| --- | ----------------------------------------------- | ---- |
| 1   | Can I describe the deliverable in ONE sentence? | ☐    |
| 2   | Is there a clear definition of "done"?          | ☐    |
| 3   | Can I estimate the hours within a 2x range?     | ☐    |
| 4   | Do I have access to everything I need to start? | ☐    |
| 5   | Am I genuinely interested, or just saying yes?  | ☐    |

**If any box is unchecked:** Reply with questions, not a quote.

## Pricing Rules

### Minimums

- **Minimum project fee: $500.** Below this, the admin overhead
  (agreement, communication, invoicing) eats your margin. Politely
  decline or suggest a larger scope.
- **Minimum hourly rate: $75/hr.** This is your floor, not your
  target. Raise it as you build reputation.

### Fixed Price vs Hourly

| Use Fixed Price When...            | Use Hourly When...                   |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Scope is clear and bounded         | Scope is exploratory or evolving     |
| You can estimate hours confidently | Client wants ongoing support         |
| Project is under 40 hours          | Project is open-ended                |
| Client wants predictability        | You're unsure how deep the issues go |

**Fixed price rule:** Estimate your hours honestly, then multiply by
1.5x. That's your quote. The extra 0.5x covers the surprises you
can't predict yet. If you finish early, great — you earned efficiency.
If it takes longer, you're covered.

### The Upcharge Triggers

Add 25-50% to your base rate when:

- [ ] Client needs it "ASAP" or "by Monday" (rush fee)
- [ ] Codebase has no tests and no documentation (archaeology fee)
- [ ] Client can't clearly explain what the app does (discovery fee)
- [ ] Multiple languages or frameworks involved (complexity fee)
- [ ] You'll need access to production systems (responsibility fee)

You don't have to itemize these on the invoice. Just factor them
into the quote.

## Red Flags — Walk Away

These are signs a gig will drain you. Trust the list, not the
excitement.

🚩 **"Can you just take a quick look?"**
Translation: They want free work. The free assessment (30 min) is
YOUR offer on YOUR terms. Don't let clients define "quick."

🚩 **"We need someone who can wear many hats."**
Translation: The scope is everything and nothing. Ask for specifics.
If they can't give them, walk away.

🚩 **"Our last developer disappeared."**
Translation: They might be difficult to work with. Ask WHY the last
person left. If they can't answer honestly, be cautious.

🚩 **"We don't really have a budget, but..."**
Translation: They can't pay what you're worth. State your minimum.
If it doesn't work, that's okay — not every inquiry is a client.

🚩 **"Can we start now and figure out the contract later?"**
Translation: There will be no contract. Never start work without a
signed agreement. Ever. EVER.

🚩 **"It's mostly done, just needs a few tweaks."**
Translation: It's a disaster. Insist on the free assessment before
quoting. The assessment will reveal the real scope.

🚩 **Vague deliverables after two rounds of questions.**
If you've asked twice and still can't define "done," this client
doesn't know what they want. You can't deliver undefined work.
Walk away or offer a paid discovery phase ($500-1000) to DEFINE
the scope before doing the work.

## Scope Creep Defense

### The Golden Rule

**If the scope changes, the price changes.**

Say it out loud before every client call. Write it in every proposal.

### When They Ask for "Just One More Thing"

Use this exact script:

> "Happy to help with that! That's outside our current scope, so let
> me put together a quick quote for the additional work. I'll have it
> to you by [tomorrow/end of day]."

Do NOT:

- Say "sure, I can squeeze that in"
- Say "no problem, it's small"
- Do it and mention it later
- Feel guilty about it

The scope was agreed on. Additional work = additional pay. This is
normal. This is professional. This is how it works.

### The 10% Rule

If a "small addition" would take less than 10% of the original
project hours AND you're feeling generous, you can absorb it as
goodwill. But ONLY if:

- The main project is going well
- The client has been respectful and communicative
- You genuinely want to do it (not guilt)
- It will not delay the original deliverables

If any of those aren't true, quote it separately.

## The ADHD-Specific Rules

These are for YOU, specifically, based on what you told me about
how your brain works.

### 1. Sleep on every proposal.

Write the quote. Save the draft. Send it TOMORROW. The overnight
gap catches the "yes impulse" before it costs you.

### 2. One active project at a time.

You can have multiple clients in different phases (one in
assessment, one in progress, one in warranty). But only ONE should
be in active "building" mode at a time. Your brain does not
multithread on deep work. Don't pretend it does.

### 3. Time-box the free assessment.

Set a 30-minute timer. When it rings, STOP. Write up what you found.
Send it. The assessment is a gift — don't let it become the project.

### 4. Track hours from minute one.

Use a timer app (Toggl is free). Start it when you open their repo.
Stop it when you close it. Do NOT estimate hours from memory at the
end of the week. Your sense of time is unreliable (this is an ADHD
thing, not a you thing).

### 5. Celebrate finishing.

When you deliver a project, do something that feels good. Coffee
shop trip. Favorite meal. A walk. Your brain needs the dopamine hit
of completion to build the habit loop. Don't just immediately open
the next project.

## Quick Reference: Project Sizes

| Size       | Hours     | Typical Fee    | Examples                                      |
| ---------- | --------- | -------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| **Small**  | 5-15 hrs  | $500-$1,500    | Security audit report, bug fixes, code review |
| **Medium** | 15-40 hrs | $1,500-$4,000  | Auth refactor, API hardening, test suite      |
| **Large**  | 40-80 hrs | $4,000-$10,000 | Full codebase refactor, production hardening  |
| **XL**     | 80+ hrs   | $10,000+       | Architecture overhaul, multi-system work      |

For Large and XL: break into phases with separate quotes per phase.
Never quote 80+ hours as a single deliverable. Break it up.

<!-- AUTUMN'S NOTES:
- Review this sheet monthly and adjust rates upward as you get busier
- After 5 completed projects, raise your minimum rate by $25/hr
- After 10 completed projects, raise your minimum project fee to $750
- Keep a running list of red flags you encounter — add them here
- The 1.5x multiplier on fixed-price estimates is NOT padding. It's
  experience tax. Every senior freelancer does this. Don't feel bad.
