**Title:** Code Cleanup, Security Hardening & Production-Ready Refactoring

**Rate:** $75/hr

**Overview:**

You shipped something. It works. That matters more than most people realize.

But there's a gap between "it runs" and "I trust it." Maybe the codebase has more duplication than you'd like. Maybe the security feels like guesswork. Maybe AI tools got you to launch and now you need a human to look under the hood. Whatever brought you here, you don't need to explain yourself. You need someone to go through the code and make it right.

That's what I do. I clean up and refactor messy codebases into something maintainable. I audit for security vulnerabilities: broken auth, missing validation, exposed secrets, the things that break quietly. I set up CI/CD and deployment so the project keeps running on its own.

Stack: SvelteKit, TypeScript, Python, Node.js, Cloudflare Workers, SQLite/PostgreSQL, OAuth 2.0, GitHub Actions.

I built a full SaaS platform from scratch. Auth, payments, email, database, media storage, admin panel. I use AI tools every day. I know where they help and where they fall apart.

Async, remote, clear communication. You get tested code and a summary of what changed and why.
